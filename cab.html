					<description>Saturday, September 21st, 9:00 am - Cannon River Winery
Bernie King and the Guilty Pleasures came into being in early 2010 when they put together a group for a local jug band contest. The synergy between original members Bernie King, Julie King, Matt Smith, and John Kurtis Dehn was so natural and right that they decided to keep on making great music as a band. And that&#x2019;s exactly what they did as witnessed by the release of two great albums, 2012&#x2019;s Bernie King and the Guilty Pleasures and 2014&#x2019;s Pretty Little Gal.</description>
