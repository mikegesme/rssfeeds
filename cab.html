The SOBS (Singers on Barstools) One of Minnesota&#x2019;s longest running acoustic groups. Playing over 1,400 shows the past 13 years! Playing songs that span decades and genres, the SOBS are eerily good at pulling off most anything you request!. We are and acoustic trio/duo. We started this band to play the songs we like, take requests from the crowd and have fun doing what we do. So far I think it&#x2019;s worked pretty well.</description>

Drive South is an acoustic trio performing eclectic folk and slices of Americana music fused from folk, country, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll. These honestly sung songs from the heart result in real music for real people.
Mark Juenemann, Mark Hedenstrom, and Scott Cummings have been actively involved in the music scene for more than 20 years. With backgrounds rooted in stage, songwriting, and recording, they look to paint a picture of real people striving for depth, beauty and emotion, creating a tone of genuine heartache and joy that bring about meaning in life.
Drive South invites you to come, sit a spell and hear narrative songs and ballads, spinning tales with wit and charm.</description>
