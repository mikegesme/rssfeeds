The SOBS (Singers on Barstools) One of Minnesota&#x2019;s longest running acoustic groups. Playing over 1,400 shows the past 13 years! Playing songs that span decades and genres, the SOBS are eerily good at pulling off most anything you request!. We are and acoustic trio/duo. We started this band to play the songs we like, take requests from the crowd and have fun doing what we do. So far I think it&#x2019;s worked pretty well.</description>
