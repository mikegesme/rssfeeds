Join us in the new Banquet Room at the beautiful Artisan Plaza in Cannon Falls for a fun evening creating rustic wood signs!
Choose from over 150 design options. Go to PROJECT DESIGNS to see sign sizes, designs and price. All signs are handmade and pre-assembled per your request of orientation; straight or staggered. You will stain the color of your choice-several options are available. A stencil will be applied then painted with your choice of over 50 paint colors. No experience is needed, and we will guide you step by step! Please note: this is a wood workshop so your sign will have random imperfections, chips, knots and other natural blemishes that give it character and will make your piece unique.
Please register by March 19 to allow us time to prepare your supplies.</description>
