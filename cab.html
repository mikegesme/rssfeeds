Voted one of Northfield&#x2019;s best bands, the 3 members of Relativity like to keep their music current. They play songs you&#x2019;ll hear on the radio today from artists such as The Civil Wars &amp; the Avett Brothers. Relativity&#x2019;s musical selections also include many old favorites, from classic rock tunes by bands like Fleetwood Mac &amp; John Mellencamp to such varied artists as the Indigo Girls, Damien Rice, &amp; Sarah McLachlan.</description>
